# CRA TS Starter Kit

## Tools Stack

- React, TypeScript, EsLint, Jest

## File Structure

## Code Base: Major Decisions

### Style

**Reset**: Eric Meyer's // TODO - EXPLAIN WHY AND WHERE IS IT

**Import**: Modular CSS makes just sense, specially with all the benefits of React Components.

**Conventions**: For this project I decided to apply BEM naming convention \*2 // TODO - EXPLAIN WHY

```
BEM + Modular CSS + React Components = SUCCESS.
```

## Config

### Styles

- The current configuration already allows us to use CSS pre-processors. BUT we are not going to make us any of them (WHAT? WHY?):
  - Firstly, because I believe in plain CSS.
  - Second, still didn't find a legitimate excuse to adopt such complexity. CSS Variables? The language already have them. Expressions? I doubt that we will ever need them.
